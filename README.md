## Description
This folder contains three files with three different questions in each file.

The first question is a swap case function. It swaps the input strings individual letters from capital letters to small letters and small letters to capital letters. The chosen input string in this case is 'The Quick Brown Fox'. The output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'. 

The second question is a generate array function. It is a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers and generates an array between them. The chosen numbers in this case are 4 and 7. The output should be [4, 5, 6, 7]. Also, -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

The third question is a prime numbers function. The function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. The implementation ensures efficient identification of prime numbers and returns them in the same order as they appear in the input array. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the output should be [2, 3, 5, 7]
